# File-Interface


## Summary
C application that creates, alters, and stores files into a standardized system. Created as a CS college course project.

## Purpose
Mainly created as a CS course project. If i can recall, me and my partner wanted to implement more utilities into the program, but ran out of time due to time constraints. We planned to go back and add on additional features, yet the semester was a rough one and we never got back to it. Would love to give this application another view and see if anything can be optimized/added.

## Instructions
The program was run through a local environment. Running the makefile of the project in a corresponding IDE should enable the program to function properly.
