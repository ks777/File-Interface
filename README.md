## Summary
C application that creates, alters, and stores files into a standardized system. Created as a CS college course project.

## Update
If i can recall, me and my partner wanted to implement more utilities into the program, but ran out of time due to time constraints. We planned to go back and add on additional features, yet the semester was a rough one and we never got back to it. Would love to give this application another view and see if anything can be optimized/added.

## Instructions
The program was run through an a local environment. Running the makefile of the project should enable the program to function properly.
